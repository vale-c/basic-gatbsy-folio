It's been quite a long time since my previous post, and I figured it was about time to come back with a few updates as I had promised!

So a few weeks ago I finished my Cybersecurity class at Georgia Tech and I gotta say that it was indeed a really nice chance for me to brush up on my C programming skills and put on a hacker hat!

The projects were engaging as they covered many different aspects of cybersecurity (they also came with very detailed prompts), ranging from very low-level stuff during the first part of the course (we had to hack our way into a shell ðŸ¤“) to then touch on web security topics (i.e. XSS, CSRF, etc.)

Overall, I would say I learn quite a bunch of useful things about cybersecurity as this class gave me more perspective and various tools that I can now draw from when thinking about the potential threats & attacks in real world scenarios.

So I'd definitely recommend taking [this class](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6035-introduction-to-information-security) if you're new to the realm of cybersecurity and you wanna have a chance to challenge yourself by completing some interesting projects about cryptography & web security.

Needless to say that these past few months have been hectic to say the least, and that it was quite challenging to balance my full-time job as a Front-end Engineer with the workload coming from the OMSCS program (as the homework was usually time-consuming).

But I pushed through till the very end and now I am pretty satisfied with the way that things turned out eventually since I am continuously trying to expand my knowledge and skills as a Software Engineer and being able to discover so many different areas of Computer Science is something inspiring and motivating.

So crazy to think that another year is almost over though! ðŸ¤¯

I truly hope that 2022 can be the start of new exciting beginnings for everyone.

Anyhow, in the meantime...Stay tuned, and keep on coding my friends! âœ¨
