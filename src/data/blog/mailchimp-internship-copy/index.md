**12 incredible Weeks as a UX Designer Intern**

<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
There would be so many things and anecdotes to talk about which contributed to making my internship experience at Mailchimp truly unique.<br/><br/>

And a simple blog post cannot capture all the magic concentrated in the span of _12 weeks_, so I am just going to highlight a few key aspects that made this summer absolutely unforgettable.<br/><br/>

Working with the Design System team as a UX Engineer has been such an exciting part of my journey to Atlanta, and it made me understand about how important it is to have a great sense of team work and cooperation when starting to conceptualise the building blocks of a whole new Design System.<br/><br/>

As a matter of fact, having a clear sense of _direction_ and a _vision_ is not enough, as the mission of a _Design System_ team is to standardise and make the visual elements of a User Experience fully accessible, well-documented and completely in-line with the company vision and strategy.<br/><br/>

It is no easy task, believe me.<br/><br/>

But thatâ€™s part and parcel of the fun of it.<br/><br/>

Using the latest technologies and frameworks to bring to life the _User Interface_ of a product is such a great and _empowering_ feeling, and being able to actively contribute to the various discussions with the team and receiving feedback along the way, makes the whole process so much smoother and enjoyable.<br/><br/>

I feel so **lucky** to have had this opportunity to work with such _talented people_, and every day felt like a whole new chapter to continue _being inspired_ and motivated to see things grow and change.
