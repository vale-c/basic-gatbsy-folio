I built this Web Application with **React.js**.

It’s a project I had been wanting to create for a while, since I am very keen on data analysis and what better way to create an app to compare city data, right ?! 😉

I used Teleport’s API to fetch the city stats & data, and axios as a tool to properly adapt the API calls with React.
