## An attempt to recreate the Momentum Dashboard

A while ago I decided I wanted to build a custom React Web App inspired by the Momentum Dashboard.
<br></br>

## Main Project Features ⚙️

• It is Bootstrapped with [“Create React App“](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

• It uses the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/developers) to fetch a new awesome wallpaper 🖼️ at every refresh.

• It uses the [Forismatic API](https://forismatic.com/en/api/) to get random interesting Quotes every time 📜.

• It uses [Geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to get accurate info about your current location 🗺️.

• It uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) integration to get precise Weather Data ☁️.
