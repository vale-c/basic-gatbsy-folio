## My personal attempt to recreate the Momentum Dashboard

A while ago I decided I wanted to build a custom React Web App inspired by the Momentum Dashboard.

# Main Project Features

1. It is Bootstrapped with “Create React App“.
2. It uses the Unsplash API to fetch an awesome wallpaper for every refresh.
3. It uses the Forismatic API to get random interesting Quotes every time.
4. It uses Geolocation to get accurate info about your current location.
5. It uses OpenWeather API integration to get precise Weather Data.
