![CityStatsApp](./citystats-content.png)

<br><br/>
I built this Web Application with **React.js**.
<br><br/>
Itâ€™s a project I had been wanting to create for a while, since I am very keen on data analysis and what better way to create an app to compare city data, right ?! ðŸ˜‰
<br><br/>
Check out the live demo <a href="http://citystats.netlify.com/" target="_blank"> here </a>, and also the full <a href="https://github.com/vale-c/CityStatsExplorer" target="_blank"> Github repo </a> with the code.
<br><br/>
I used Teleportâ€™s API to fetch the city stats & data, and axios as a tool to properly adapt the API calls with React.
